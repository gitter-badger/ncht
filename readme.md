#ncht

##What is it?

ncht is a fast, lightweight and cool chat system which is based on Node.js. It is supposed to become a fully fledged chat application, with features like nicknames, online lists, moderation and such. As of now, it is still in heavy development.

##Can I use it?

Probably not. We haven't even started on the actual 'chat' part yet.

##How do I contribute?

1. Clone the repo.
2. `npm i`
3. Use `gulp sass` for compiling stylesheets.
4. Make a pull request! (make sure your SCSS is compiled)

##Who made this?

That would be us. We are two hobby programmers and web developers sitting in front of our computers everyday to bring you this piece of whateveritisrightnow:
